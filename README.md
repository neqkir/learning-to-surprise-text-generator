We develop a method for generating creative text according to Boden's definition of creativity. 

*“Boden identifies three forms of creativity: combinatorial, exploratory and transformational creativity. Combinatorial creativity is about making unfamiliar combinations of familiar ideas; the definition of the other two, instead, is based on conceptual spaces, i.e., structured styles of thought (any disciplined way of thinking that is familiar to a certain culture or peer group): exploratory creativity involves the exploration of the structured conceptual space, while transformational creativity involves changing the conceptual space in a way that new thoughts, previously inconceivable, become possible.”*

Deep Creator must have a combinatorial and exploratory creativity. Transformational is of secondary importance because we want Deep Creator to produce according to some author or in the style of. We can therefore afford to stay in the same space. Deep Creator should also show creative within its pasture, featuring all aspects of creativity, in particularly the much sought after surprise.  

While GANs, LSTMs, transformers produce new and valuable artifacts, they lack sparkles of surprise. An audience-composer architecture seems the framework of choice to instill surprise, with an exploratory behavior, and we will therefore explore this direction.
